Overview

This frontend provides a simple playable UI for the 4 in a Row multiplayer game.

It connects directly to the WebSocket backend (ws://localhost:8080) and renders the 7Ã—6 grid in real-time. Players can click on columns to drop discs, watch the opponentâ€™s moves live, and see the game result.
